	<p class="fade">I'm a <b>final year</b> PhD candidate working with the <i>fabulous</i> <a href="https:faculty.washington.edu/ajko/">Amy J. Ko</a>.
	My work seeks to create cultural shifts to move computing from a force that magnifies societal oppression to a force for collective liberation.
	To accomplish this, my work intersects computer science, sociology, and social work to surface, deconstruct, and challenge dominant cultural norms within computing.
	</p>

<p class="fade">
	For my dissertation, I examined cultural norms in three spaces: computing students' career decisions, narratives surrounding student cheating, and what expressions of neurodiversity are legitimized within computing spaces.
	Within published work, I've found that cultural expectations within some CS departments teach students to prioritize career prestige, giving little space or support to pursue other options.
</p>
<p class="fade">
	Cultural norms in hand, I've also created pedagogical space to challenge them; I worked with students to co-construct a space where students with established computing identities could present themselves more fully.
	I've also worked to integrate critical pedagogy into computer systems courses, surfacing students understandings of how we got here, instead of solely explaining how computer systems work.
</p>
	<!-- I've been exploring the factors that inform computing students' career decisions, or why so many graduates from prestigious CS programs go to work at one of four companies (in review). --> 
	<!-- I hope that one day, more computing learners can find work that affirms their personhood, honors their narratives, and brings about collective liberation.</p> -->

<!-- <p class="fade">I'm also working on integrating  I taught an introductory systems course in Summer 2021 and used "The House of Computing" as a metaphor for structural critique.</p> -->

<!-- /* I've dubbed myself a "recovering computer architect", I researched manycore compiler solutions with <a href="https:michaeltaylor.org/">Micheal Taylor</a> and intermittent FPGAs and multithreading support with <a href="https:brandonlucia.com/">Brandon Lucia</a>, before switching to computing education. */ -->

<p class="fade">
	Before I pivoted to computing education, I earned my Master's and Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and engaged in computer architecture research around manycore compiler solutions, intermittently-powered FPGAs, and multi-threading support for intermittent architectures.
	I promise, I'm still a computer scientist, I just find engaging with computing culture so much more fascinating than purely technical innovation.

<p class="fade">I identify as white, non-binary, trans, queer, and neurodivergent to recognize my position and find affinity with others.</p>

<p class="fade">
	Beyond my current work, I'm curious about how to support students in identity work, as well as how to support instructors engaging in deeply vulnerable pedagogical spaes.
	Norms-wise, I'm also excited to explore the mechanisms by which computing culture teaches individuals to forget their body, the ramifications of a dis-embodied practice (especically among marginalized learners), and how we might invite the body to return into computing's disciplinary space.
