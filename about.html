<div class="about">
<p class="fade">Hi, I'm Mara!  I'm a 4th year PhD student working with <a href="https:faculty.washington.edu/ajko/">Amy J. Ko</a>. I study how to encourage computing students to pursue work that allows for greater self-expression and acts as a force for collective liberation.</p>

<p class="fade">I've been exploring the factors that inform computing students' career decisions, or why so many graduates from prestigious CS programs go to work at one of four companies (in review). I hope that one day, more computing learners can find work that affirms their personhood, honors their narratives, and brings about collective liberation.</p>

<p class="fade">I'm also working on integrating critical pedagogy into computer systems courses, surfacing students understandings of how we got here, instead of solely explaining how computer systems work. I taught an introductory systems course in Summer 2021 and used "The House of Computing" as a metaphor for structural critique.</p>

<!-- /* I've dubbed myself a "recovering computer architect", I researched manycore compiler solutions with <a href="https:michaeltaylor.org/">Micheal Taylor</a> and intermittent FPGAs and multithreading support with <a href="https:brandonlucia.com/">Brandon Lucia</a>, before switching to computing education. */ -->
<p class="fade">I identify as non-binary transgender, neurodiverse, and queer, mostly to find affinity than bother with politiking.</p>

<p class="fade">There's so much that interests me outside of my current research: queering texts and media, scalable therapeutic interventions, managing capacity in care work, the intersections of personal trauma and systemic oppression (especially when they manifest in bodies), bikes, guitar, yoga, many others.</p>
