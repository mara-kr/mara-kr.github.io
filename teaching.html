		<p class="fade">
			A co-constructed seminar that examined CS cultural norms, considered how these norms are reinforced, and explored, in community, how students experience these norms.
			This was a discussion based space, focused on building community through vulnerable self-expression among students.
			Unlike similar justice-centered computing spaces, I worked with students who had already developed an identity within computing and felt some degree of disciplinary obligation to maintain computing's cultural norms.
			I advocated for, designed, and taught this course as part of my dissertation work.</p>

		<b class="fade"><a class="coursename" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/21su">CSE 351: The Hardware/Software Interface</a></b>
	<p class="fade">
			An introduction to systems software, covering data representation, assembly, cache hierarchies and memory management. This is UW's version of the prototypical required systems course.
			For my offering, I embedded critical counternarratives into nearly every lecture, developed an overarching metaphor for students to structurally critique computing as a discipline, and replaced examinations with an opportunity for students to creatively demonstrate connections between technical and socio-technical material, all without removing existing course content.

	<p class="fade">
		During my undergraduate and master's, I had the privilege of serving as a teaching assistant for nearly every course in computer hardware, computer architecture and embedded systems offered by Carnegie Mellon University (8 semesters worth), and received the Electrical and Computer Engineering department's award for Outstanding Teaching Assistant upon completing my degree.
	</p>
	<p class="fade">
		During my PhD, in addition to the courses I've taught, I've served as a teaching assistant for courses in computer systems and computer architecture, frequently working with instructors to incorporate critical content or improve students' pedagogical experience.
