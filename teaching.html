	I've taught twice, both with a myriad of novel curricular additions.
	If either of these interest and excite you, let me know; I'd be delighted to talk more.

	<p>
			A co-constructed seminar that examined CS cultural norms, considered how these norms are reinforced, and explored, in community, how students experience these norms.
			This was a discussion based space, focused on building community through vulnerable self-expression among students.
			Unlike similar justice-centered computing spaces, I worked with students who had already developed an identity within computing and felt some degree of disciplinary obligation to maintain computing's cultural norms.
			I advocated for, designed, and taught this course as part of my dissertation work.</p>

		<b><a class="coursename" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse351/21su">CSE 351: The Hardware/Software Interface</a></b>
	<p>
			An introduction to systems software, covering data representation, assembly, cache heirarchies and memory management. This is UW's version of the prototypical required systems course.
			For my offering, I embedded critical counternarratives into nearly every lecture, developed an overarching metaphor for students to structurally critique computing as a discipline, and replaced examinations with an oppourtunity for students to creatively demonstrate connections between technical and socio-technical material, all without removing existing course content.
