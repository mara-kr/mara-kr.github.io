<p class="fade">
Just as norms govern behavior within society broadly, norms govern behavior within computer science spaces. These norms are often invisible, the quiet "rhythms of the world", wholly assumed and without question. Fitting norms, and the expectations that come with them, often grants privilege, power, and access, thus many individuals consciously and unconsciously constrict themselves to fit. Those who cannot, or those for whom the weight of constraint is too great to bear, are often disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and marginalized. In this course, we'll look at some norms in society broadly and how they reinforce systems of oppression, then lower into computing spaces and computer science to examine the norms within computer science learning spaces (for instance, the Allen School) and beyond.

<p class="fade">
Naturally, this won't be like other courses within the Allen School, Informatics, or other computing majors, deconstructing norms is often emotional work, especially if you haven't encountered them before. So, as we surface norms within computing, we'll be doing some unpacking! Norms often have systemic ramifications beyond individual behavior, and (perhaps more importantly) often become personal, intertwined with our own tangled histories and experiences. You won't be doing this work alone (unless you really want to) --- we'll be utilizing strategies for untangling ourselves as we work together to cultivate alternative courses of practice and action. Deconstructing norms and our responses to them is an exceedingly valuable skill, the usefulness of which extends well beyond our work as technologists and into our "collective vocation to become more fully human" (to quote Paulo Freire).

I have some expertise here (it's my PhD thesis), so we'll be building on some work that I've done around careers, critical theory, and neurodivergence, as well as strategies that I've employed: deep attention, radical listening, situating care, metaphor modeling, and embodied practice. That said, some of you might come with practices, tools, stories, and experiences that have served you well; I'm excited for this to be a space of collaborative learning.

You might ask, is this ethics? Kind of! But, not really. Ethics is more concerned with what decision is "right", within some decision-making framework. Ethics is incredibly useful, especially when incorporating critical and anti-racist framings â€” CSE 480 does a great job here. There's a tendency, however, for ethics to center intellectualization: viewing decisions through structured frameworks of reasoning, rather than centering feelings, personhood, and identity (which is more of our focus here). Ethics philosophies are helpful and critical theory can be a wonderful guide, but navigating ethically-nebulous decisions without a deep self-knowledge probably isn't going to suddenly create space for critical action.I'd argue that's more likely to come from disentangling who you are from how others expect you to be.

	<center><h3>Objectives</h3></center>
		<p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
<ul>
			<li>Articulate how social norms are replicated through education, both from theoretical (Bourdieusian, or your favorite) and personal lenses</li>
			<li>Recognize career norms within computing, and their ties to broader structures of power</li>
			<li>Better understand their own neurotype, neurodivergence broadly, and the interplay between neurodivergence and computing</li>
			<li>Have built a practice of sitting with themselves and others in deconstructing social norms.</li>
			<li>(Hopefully) Leave this course more wholly human than they entered (As will I, I'm sure)</li>
</ul>

<center><h3>Expectations</h3></center>
	<!-- TODO: Edit it's co-constructed, expectations are 3hr per week -->
	<p>
		Again, this won't be like other courses in CSE; the closest analogue is a reading seminar where students read material before class, material that enriches a class discussion.
		More concretely, this is a 1-credit seminar that meets for two hours per week, and so I'll expect that y'all spend an hour outside of class time on course material.
		Though, stepping away from the ableist hegemony of higher education, nothing is outright "required", though, lovingly, <i>any discernible benefit from being here is directly related to the degree to which you show up</i>.
		For instance, It's less that readings are less "assigned" and more that the readings have been pivotal in my sense of understanding myself and I'd really appreciate that if you have the space to read, you give the readings some time.
		I'll also ask for some reflections from y'all throughout the course; these are similarly not required, but I'd wholly appreciate the opportunity to understand where y'all are at, a bit more.
		With all of this, I'd really appreciate that if you don't have time to do readings or prepare, you're not upset at yourself on my behalf.
		Feel how you're going to feel for you, but I'll always be delighted that you show up to class, <i>especially</i> if you haven't done the reading, <i>especially</i> if it's a tough week, I'll always be delighted to have you here.
		This course is co-constructed, meaning that y'all have just as much say in where we go and what's required of you as I do; I'm far more concerned with making this course meaningful for you than any preconceptions that I have about how things "should" be (though, I reserve some institutionally conferred authority to steer).
		</p>

		<p>
		Most importantly, I'll ask you, repeatedly, lovingly, and with grace, to be vulnerable with yourself and with your classmates in this course.
		We'll be talking about some potentially achy topics throughout, potentially surfacing some achy feelings, and leaving with more questions than we started, but not necessarily more answered.
			This will be a consent-based exploratory process meaning that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>You can leave any discussion, at any time, and you don't need to be polite about it.</b> Just walk out. I'll send a check-in email after class, and I'd be honored to hold space to understand why you left (though, you can 100% ghost me on this).</li>
			<li>Everything is optional, every reading, every reflection, every class period, every discussion question, every prompt, everything. You maintain the power of refusal, and I'll do what I can to ensure that there aren't any penalties for refusing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We'll maintain collaborative list of classroom norms <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tO2Hk2MPWZMRQglo5Us6nA7P02y6W_bsJX_QzklQKjs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. You'll all have comment access, I'll respond to anything you surface and do my best to synthesize.

<center><h3>Definitions</h3></center>
		<p>We'll use some <i>fancy</i> (i.e. academic) terms throughout this, I'll keep a list here in case you need to refresh yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>narratives</b> are contextual, subjective, and flexible stories of past, present, and future that individuals use to shape their experience within a broad reality, what futures we see as possible, and what capacity we have to create those futures.</li>
	<li><b>norms</b> are the assumptions that constraint both the content of narratives (e.g. what futures are possible, what types of people we can become), and the ways that narratives are told (e.g. that stories must thematically involve redemption).</li>
</ul>
