Just as norms govern behavior within society broadly, norms govern behavior within computer science spaces. These norms are often invisible, the quiet "rhythms of the world", wholly assumed and without question. Fitting norms, and the expectations that come with them, often grants privilege, power, and access, thus many individuals consciously and unconsciously constrict themselves to fit. Those who cannot, or those for whom the weight of constraint is too great to bear, are often disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and marginalized. In this course, we'll look at some norms in society broadly and how they reinforce systems of oppression, then lower into computing spaces and computer science to examine the norms within computer science learning spaces (for instance, the Allen School) and beyond.

Naturally, this won't be like other courses within the Allen School, Informatics, or other computing majors, deconstructing norms is often emotional work, especially if you haven't encountered them before. So, as we surface norms within computing, we'll be doing some unpacking! Norms often have systemic ramifications beyond individual behavior, and (perhaps more importantly) often become personal, intertwined with our own tangled histories and experiences. You won't be doing this work alone (unless you really want to) --- we'll be utilizing strategies for untangling ourselves as we work together to cultivate alternative courses of practice and action. Deconstructing norms and our responses to them is an exceedingly valuable skill, the usefulness of which extends well beyond our work as technologists and into our "collective vocation to become more fully human" (to quote Paulo Freire).

I have some expertise here (it's my PhD thesis), so we'll be building on some work that I've done around careers, critical theory, and neurodivergence, as well as strategies that I've employed: deep attention, radical listening, situating care, metaphor modeling, and embodied practice. That said, some of you might come with practices, tools, stories, and experiences that have served you well; I'm excited for this to be a space of collaborative learning.

You might ask, is this ethics? Kind of! But, not really. Ethics is more concerned with what decision is "right", within some decision-making framework. Ethics is incredibly useful, especially when incorporating critical and anti-racist framings — CSE 480 does a great job here. There's a tendency, however, for ethics to center intellectualization: viewing decisions through structured frameworks of reasoning, rather than centering feelings, personhood, and identity (which is more of our focus here). Ethics philosophies are helpful and critical theory can be a wonderful guide, but navigating ethically-nebulous decisions without a deep self-knowledge probably isn't going to suddenly create space for critical action.I'd argue that's more likely to come from disentangling who you are from how others expect you to be.

By the end of this course, students will:
<ul>
			<li>Articulate how social norms are replicated through education, both from theoretical (Bourdieusian, or your favorite) and personal lenses</li>
			<li>Recognize career norms within computing, and their ties to broader structures of power</li>
			<li>Better understand their own neurotype, neurodivergence broadly, and the interplay between neurodivergence and computing</li>
			<li>Have built a practice of sitting with themselves and others in deconstructing social norms.</li>
			<li>Leave this course more wholly human than they entered (As will I, I'm sure)</li>

<center><h3>Expectations</h3></center>
	<!-- TODO: Edit it's co-constructed, expectations are 3hr per week -->
This will be a reading and discussion seminar where students will read prior to class and then class will enrich the reading experience.  In that sense it’s a “normal reading seminar.”  The difference will be one of emphasis in two regards.  First, students will reflect more on their own narratives, why they are in the field, how their sense of belonging is challenged and intersects with cultural norms, and what is their experience in computing’s culture.  This is different from a more typical dispassionate scholarly investigation based on external observation of other people/things/systems.  Second, the goal is to create a seminar community that has a lot of agency in the direction the seminar takes and how class time is used, so the plan is moderately more tbd than for a typical seminar.

<center><h3>Definitions</h3></center>
We'll use norms and narratives somewhat interchangeably — to be explicit:
<ul>
	<li><b>narratives</b> are contextual, subjective, and flexible stories of past, present, and future that individuals use to shape their experience within a broad reality, what futures we see as possible, and what capacity we have to create those futures.</li>
	<li><b>norms</b> are the assumptions that constraint both the content of narratives (e.g. what futures are possible, what types of people we can become) , and the ways that narratives are told (e.g. stories must thematically involve redemption).</li>
</ul>
